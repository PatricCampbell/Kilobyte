Kilobyte is a browser game inspired by 1024. The object of Kilobyte is to create a tile of value 1024. The player starts with two tiles of value 2 and must combine same number tiles. This adds up the value in the tiles in a new tile. The game ends when the whole board is full or when a tile reaches 1024.

# Future Features

#### High scores saved on the backend using FireBase so that users can compete against each other.
